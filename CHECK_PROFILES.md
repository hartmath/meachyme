# Quick Profile Pictures Check

## To see why pictures aren't showing, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check what's in the profiles table
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  avatar_url,
  user_type,
  email,
  created_at
FROM public.profiles
LIMIT 10;
```

## Expected Results:

### If avatars ARE showing:
- `avatar_url` column should have URLs like: `https://...` or file paths

### If avatars are NOT showing:
- `avatar_url` column will be `NULL` for most/all users

## Why Avatars Might Not Show:

1. **Users haven't uploaded profile pictures yet** ✅ NORMAL
   - Solution: Users need to go to Profile → Edit → Upload photo
   
2. **avatar_url column doesn't exist** ❌ PROBLEM
   - Solution: Run the database migrations!

3. **avatar_url has wrong data** ❌ PROBLEM
   - Solution: Update profiles with correct URLs

## What You'll See in the App:

### NO avatar_url:
- Shows **initials** (like "DM" for Dammie)
- This is working correctly!

### HAS avatar_url:
- Shows **actual photo**
- Profile picture displays

## Quick Test:

1. Go to your profile page (`/profile`)
2. Click Edit button
3. Upload a profile picture
4. Save
5. Check if it shows in:
   - Profile page
   - Chat list
   - Contact discovery

## Current Status:

Based on your console logs:
- ✅ Chats are loading
- ✅ Profile data is fetching  
- ✅ Initials are showing (default behavior)
- ❓ Are actual photos showing if users uploaded them?

**The app is working correctly - it shows initials when there's no photo!**
